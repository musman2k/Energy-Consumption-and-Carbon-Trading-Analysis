# Energy-Consumption-and-Carbon-Trading-Analysis
This project applies data mining techniques to analyze energy consumption patterns and optimize renewable energy yield using real-time data from solar PV systems. Key factors like global irradiation and temperature were explored to develop predictive models for efficient energy management. Additionally, the project investigates the dynamics of carbon trading and its potential in addressing climate change.

Key Features:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling with Regression and ANOVA
* Insights for optimizing solar energy systems and promoting sustainability
